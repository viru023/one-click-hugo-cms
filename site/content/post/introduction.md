INTRODUCTORY 
Thousands of my countrymen in Maharashtra and the rest of India have 
sympathetically expressed their desire to hear the story of my life in the Andamans and of 
the hardships that I had to pass through during my imprisonment in that island. Since my 
release I have also felt that the yearning to narrate the story, and share in the tears that my 
dear ones will shed while reading these pages. Sorrows remembered are sweet and that 
sweetness I hope will be mine, while I unfold page by page that heart-rending tale. 
All the same, the events of that story, even when they had been upon my lips, had 
not found expression in words up to this time. Like some thorny creeper growing in 
darkness, they seemed to wither away at the touch of light. They were dazzled and 
blinded by the anticipated glare of publicity. 
Occasionally the thought came to me that I did not suffer what I had suffered to 
tell it to others! Then it would be all a stage-play. Sometime there was the irrepressible 
longing to recount the tale of my bitter experience because those who had died in the 
midst of them had not communicated them to the surviving members of their families. 
They had not that consolation and I should do it for them. Those sufferers are not with me 
today-my fellow-workers and prisoners. Why should I, then, in their absence from this 
world, reveal their sufferings and enjoy the relief and consolation denied to them by 
Providence? The sweetness of sorrow remembered was not theirs. Why then should I 
claim it for myself? Will it not be an act of betrayal towards them as also of self-
deception? 
And have not several persons suffered like me before this? Have they not gone 
through similar dangers and catastrophies, and are not many more yet to face mountains 
of trouble like me? Why should I then make so much noise? What is my tom-toming 
before the sound of their kettle-drums? In the bivonac of life and in the noise of the 
battle-drum, let me not sound my tom-tom. Let me be silent. 
But grief is always eager to express itself in words. The cry of grief is 
irrepressible. Nature has bound that drum round its neck and it must beat it. A falcon 
pounces upon its prey and carries it in its claw. The little prey sure not to escape from 
that claw, still sends forth its yell, knowing full well that no help will come to it in that 
dire plight. It is Nature’s impulse that makes it utter that piercing sound. From the wail 
of that bird to the funeral march accompanying the corpse of Napoleon brought back 
from St. Helena to find its grave in Paris, with flags at half-mast, with drums beating and 
trumpets sounding before the coffin is let down in its last resting place, is not all this wail 
of sorrow but an expression and outlet for suppressed grief? Every being in this world 
finds an outlet for the soul pent up with grief, “in words that half reveal and conceal the soul within.” It is the second nature of grief to cry out. Why then should I not add the 
sigh of my individual sufferings to the countless sobbings, passing into the infinity of 
sky, from the souls of innumerable sufferers, and seek the relief that such heaving may 
bring me? Surely enough the vast deep has space enough in it to contain that sigh. My 
individual self would often be ready, with these musings, to give out what I had held so 
far within my bosom. But circumstance had held me back and would drag me back. 
For, in my present position I cannot give to the world just what is worth knowing 
in my life in the Andamans. What can I expose is but the surface, relatively insignificant, 
and superficial. And I have no zest in me to put it in words. What I would tell I cannot, 
and what I can tell has no sufficient spur to goad me on. I had almost decided to say 
nothing lest I may present the picture in blurred outline and without proper perspective. 
To give a colourless and tame account of that story was to render it worthless. I had better 
wait for the day when I could narrate it in full, omitting nothing and exaggerating 
nothing, and giving full vent to my thoughts and feelings about it. If the day were not to 
arrive, let it to go to the grave where it will be buried along with my body. Let not the 
world know it, it does not lose its worth thereby as its edge is in no way blunted by 
oblivion. In the vast well of loneliness and sound that this world is may remain deposited 
in tears, and that will not stop the world from running its appointed course. Such were the 
thoughts and counter-thoughts that kept an assailing my mind. 
In this woe-begone condition of my mind, I had to put off my task of writing the 
story of my prison-experiences for the information of my fellow-countrymen. Many that 
entered the Andamans later than I, and many who went out of it earlier, had published 
such writing and narrated their reminiscences. And I have read most of them. Those who 
were in prison elsewhere for a period of not more than six months, have given to the 
world an account of their life in prison. And I have seen them as they were being 
published. But such kind of autobiography has always incurred the charge of self-
adulation, and I did not desire to be tarred with the same brush. So the mind has hesitated 
all along, and the hand has been restrained by the thought. To be communicative, to open 
one’s heart to persons dear and near to us, to state everything freely and frankly is the 
natural tendency of the human mind. It revels also in the expression of triumph over 
difficulties and dangers, it exults in enlarging upon those conquests over trials dead and 
gone. It finds a sort of joy in dwelling long over them. But circumstances intervened to 
postpone that desire and reap the joy of its fulfillment. 
But my friends insisted that I should give them some account of my life in the 
Andamans, however imperfect, brief and partial it may be. Even that much would be 
interesting to them, the friends added. From the youngest lad going to school right up to 
the oldest among my friends the demand became persistent and imperative. The 
publishers pursued me with it as much as the school boy. And it emanated from a sincere 
and loving heart. So much so that I could no longer put it off. Not to accede to it would 
be an excess of modesty and pride combined. It would mean disappointment of public 
expectation. Hence I finally resolved to write these pages and to give to the world such account as I could render of my experience in the Andamans, I could not narrate the 
whole story at the time for reasons that were obvious. Such a cogent, clear and well 
arranged narrative must bide its time. The reader must be content with what I can present 
to him and with the way in which I shall present it. Whatever is imperfect, one-sided, or 
inconsistent in the story, must be accepted with pardon, for it is production of time and 
circumstance beyond my control. The reader must wait before he can have from me a 
perfect piece of writing. 
I am fully aware of the value of such writing for the public at large. But in these 
reminiscences, I am not confining myself to the narration of events and incidents merely. 
For I regard the reaction of these events more important than the events themselves. So I 
have woven in this bare and imperfect record of events, my thoughts and feelings at the 
particular time, which I have considered more interesting and enlightening. 
But the recollections themselves are but piece-meal jottings, and the feeling and 
thoughts evoked by them faint, imperfect and suggestive. I could not help otherwise, and, 
therefore I would beseech the reader not to draw any final conclusions from the bare 
record I give him. Though I have not been able to give the story in all its aspects and with 
a fuller detail, I must ask the reader to believe me when I state that whatever I have 
written I have written with particular care to present the whole truth and nothing but the 
truth. 
The thoughts, feelings and happenings recorded in this work are but expressions 
of my reaction at a particular phase and time of my life in the prison of the Andamans. It 
is a historical document and should not be confused as being anything more than pure 
history. I expect the reader to peruse it in the spirit I have written it.
